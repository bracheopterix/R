Mega plan - do it all on react with blocks for pictures, video, texts.
All media are stored on other platforms and inserted by links
Bonus - daydream part with Sertaret sketches


Now we are having problem with monkey-patched footer (with class - absolute bottom)
We need to have a menu animation and logic
Losos and word game should go to another progect, but may stay by now. Losos may be an easter-egg

All blocks store in their common folder?


Menu:
pick the menu up in the form of display:hidden - by click it should go to the right position and show itself;


illustration:
you may change grid collumns to flex-collumns?

every picture on click should open itself to the 100vmin. Should they have new colored outline on hover? May it be with child selector.

if delete outline on every pic, (They would not align by horiaontal lines anyway and it is better this way) you may choose to tile background with non-border vector waves and it would be seen in gaps between pictures as dashes
But it may not be in favor of picture`s textures.
