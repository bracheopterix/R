                    <p>That day Henry got into his car, he was exhausted after a long day of work. Out of habit he looked on the hand watch his father gifted him at 21th birthday long time ago. It's minute hand was having seizures almost two months by now. In darkness he couldn`t see well but it was enough for watches silhouette to stay out.
                    And the salary wasn`t so big lately. 
                    Henry turned on inside light, it blinked and turned off immediately. Man fell down on steering wheel. "A minute in silence, just one minute" - he sighed while grabbing his watches by the other hand just to calm himself. And of course, immediately his phone played cheerful short melody, indicated that he got a message. Display shows first four words: "please deposit more money...", but Henry was fed up enough. He turns his car on and slowly rides off the parking, going towards his home to finally has some time alone just by himself. There was a beer in the fridge, waiting for his arrival. Cold sweet beer. 
                    Engine was quietly purring and car was moving by road further and further. The road was long, with new speed limitations it now should have took almost an hour . Driver saw how trees in the window were running towards the vehicle and stood far behind it. Nobody was here, just long empty road in dusk.
                </p><p>
                    But wait, a lone figure standed out with it`s hand in the air. "If I was him - I would hurry home too" - thought comes to Henry's mind - "and it seems like there not so many cars on the road, he would be waiting for a long time". He stopped by a man (and it was a man) and opened a window.
                    "what's up, pal?" - he asked. "Why so late on the road?". It was getting darker by every minute and the face of the stranger wasn't visible already. But his voice was strangely known to Henry.
                    "My car had broke up further on the road, I was on the trip to home... wait, Henry, is it you? Old friend!"
                </p><p>
                    Henry was now sure that they have met before, but couldn't remember man's name. There was an awkward pause before stranger continued:
                    "It's me, Jeffry! We haven't seen each other since graduating college!". He reached out to open the door so Henry switched off the lock. Now he remembered: Jeff was the best student in their university and he definitely has a good job by now so maybe he could offer some word or two on Henry's behalf to someone who is more significant. But this energy in Harry's voice was as annoying as many years before.
                </p><p>
                    "It seems, you didn't change at all, feels like in good old times" - said Henry and as soon as Jeffry sat down in the car, they continued their way.
                    "So, where you was going?" 
                    "I have an apartment in N town, nothing big, really" - answered Jeffry. 
                    "Oh really? I was going to N town too" - Henry rented a small dirty house at suburbs, but he didn't want to clarify it.
                     Wheels were quietly rustling on the road and their small talk went pretty well. Or Henry thought so. They watched the same TV series lately and both was hoping that Eastern Eagles would win the autumn tournament. A little bit later Henry noticed that Jeffry wasn't answering as enthusiastic as before, he started to hesitate before every answer like he was thinking what to say and… how to say. Lights in the cabin still wasn't working and rare street lamps flashed Henry's companion just for a little part of a second. 
                    "His nose looks smaller than I remember" - Henry thought - "But who am I to judge?". Plastic surgery is not a new thing in country. 
                </p><p>
                    Suddenly something distracted him - big rock jumped out of the wheels and hit the bottom of a car with loud scratch noise. Henry immediately stopped the car on the side of a road, and said as he goes out: "I will look if everything all right" - Jeffry just nodded in return.
                    In bright beams of headlights Henry turned in hands a big rock that looked like it was a deal. He took it, looked closer to see on rock's side a blue paint, scratched off his car.
                    "I found it" - he shouts - it hits a side, not a bottom - everything is alright, there no leakage!". Henry step out of the light, he saw nothing at first seconds. Vision returned slowly, but something seemed wrong. Henry did a step further to driver`s door as he saw that passenger wasn't on a right seat anymore. Instead he was on the left, both hands on the wheel! 
                    "No, no, no, no!" - shouted Henry, "Jeff, what... What are you doing?". 
                    The answer was the sound of engine, a car went a little backwards while Henry was trying to block it`s way with his body, but it didn't help and vehicle went around the man. Henry stood quietly as his car went down the road into horizon. 
                    "Fuck you!" - he shouted finally. Fuck Eagles, fuck you, bastard!". He stood here in silence.
                </p><p>
                    Time went by and then came the hunger. Henry looked up in the dark sky and sighted. Nothing to do here, he should have been at home by now. 
                    He began his walk down the road. He went and went, and at some point heard a sound far away behind him. He raised his hand in the air and wait. Soon black car stopped near him, the window went down and driver calmly asked:
                    "Hey, isn't it late pal? Want a ride?"
                    Henry was very tired, but he didn't want to look suspicious and said as excitedly as he could: "Of course! My car have been broken up further this road, and I almost lost any hope...buddy!"
                    As he says he understands that driver's voice sounds very similar. Like they have knew each other by a long time. "Fuck, he sounds just like Jeff" - he thought. Fucking son of a bitch. But a pause started to become more awkward by every second. Lights in the car was, as expected, turned off. Henry leaned towards the window but suddenly froze as he saw driver's silhouette in the car cabin. 
                    Henry's voice cracked a little bit as words comes from his mouth:
                    "I'm Bill, remember? From the college". This name expectedly (It was deffinetly Jeff!) worked as a password and car's door opens. Bill was a loner before but a good one, the successful type of guy that everyone wanted a piece of, even Jeffry.
                    "Get in Bill, I haven't see you for ages! You didn't change at all!"
                </p><p>
                    Henry sits inside the car absolutely shocked. He tried to sound cheerful and existed as would Bill do. Something, that sounds like: "Yes, Eagles way ahead other teams this season, I wouldn't bet a penny against them!" - but inside his head was other thoughts, both scary and confusing. He carefully looks to the left - his companion was very amused by their talk, he nods every now and then.
                    At some point Henry started to loose a conversation. He didn`t know what to say any more, he was afraid to say anything. And it seemed like driver began to notice it, but…
                    There must be some useful occasion on the road - thought Henry - something distracting. He waited but nothing came to his mind. Silence became so vivid like they may sense it by a hand. Henry looked at the driver while fear became bigger - he wasn`t an actor but he was not a fool either. Now he already saw no Jeffry before him, even with a surgery. Nor a stranger. Henry knew this man for a long time and he was someone very important to him, but who? 
                </p><p>
                    Driver was not comfortable either - it was obvious now, he was nervous. His arms was holding the steering wheel like it was a lifebuoy but sit silent. Henry was covered by cold sweat. He hesitated for a bit and reached out to a radio button to break this awkwardness, but it was a big mistake because his watch was now  out of his sleeve. Same watch he saw a moment earlier on the driver's hand! Same watch he could recognise with his eyes closed! 
                    Driver looked right in Henry's eyes with shock was slowly appearing on his face. In darkness just the same face looked back at him with it's eyes wide open! And Henry saw his own stupor and anger mirrored in them.
                    "Fuck off the wheel" - driver shouted in panic as loud as he could - "Or I will crack your head open!" - and Henry freezed his hands. Driver turned the steering wheel in panic to overthrow a passenger to the opposite side of the car. He succeeded but something hits car`s bottom and the vehicle went fully crazy. It fall offroad and just a second later hit the tree with all of it`s mass. And then the world went into darkness.
                </p><p>
                    Pain and noise in the ears welcomed Henry as he wakes up on the deflated airbag. Driver was silent and moveless. With shaking hands Henry took left arm of the man near him and found a week pulse under the skin. He sobed, waited a minute, unfastened the safety belt and reached out to the head of a knocked out person. He turned it to the lonely beam of light that came in the car through broken window. As he saw men's face again, he immediately run out of the car, screaming on top of his lungs but making no sound at all. It was his face, it was his watch and it was his unconscious body left in his broken car outside of nowhere. Henry had no more energy in his limbs and he falls down on the ground. 
                    "it's all over" - he thought. " I'm done, everything's done".
                    He layed here with no sign of life for a long time, at first he didn't have any will to move, no more. But then, thoughts came one after another: he felt pain, he was hungry, he was there, alive and who cares about some weirdo who looks slightly like him? He would call the ambulance as soon as he gets home. It's right and honest and it's more than enough to the man that tryed to kill him. 
                </p><p>
                    He got up, went to the car, took another man out of it and put him on the ground with head turned on it's side as he had read in one magazine long time ago. "That's right" - he said outlout -"I will do it for myself any time and let's hope everything will be allright. He just had a bad day, very bad day and i'm a good person". He got in the car and tryed to start the engine, but it was useless. Strange feeling rised up Henry's throat - he almost knew that car is dead-broken, but he became like an inflated balloon with cotton candy, nothing could get to him anymore. The phone laid where it should had been, but had a spider net of cracks on it`s little display and didn`t turn on even after a while. Henry threw it on the back sits without any emotions. 
                </p><p>
                    His mind was overwhelmed with one thought, he was going craizy with every minute of this damned day: if there are three of them on this road (Henry, Jeffry and Bill versions) - there may be more. Maybe it`s a strange loop just for every Henry that exists in the universe. There were many ends to this adventure - he would find an end to a day like Jeffry-Henry that was already at his home, or like unconscious-Henry if luck turned off him next time. But he may never became the I-am-just-out-the-work-parking Henry. And if this original Henry wouldn`t open his doors for a strange passenger - who Henry became then? And what would be with both of driver and passenger IF they will arrive home TOGETHER - what would happened to them when this loop would be closed? Would something just erase Henry for not being the original one? 
                    He was in charge not only for his life, but for his twin near the broken car too.
                    Henry looked around and saw only a lonely road in both ways to the horizon that hadn`t changed even slightly from the first minutes of ride.
                    "Well" - he said - "let's say that someone would be there soon" - then giggled and started to walk. "It's me, Jeffry! My car broke up further on the road…"
